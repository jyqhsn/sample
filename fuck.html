		<ul>
			<li><b>Hollywood Sign</b>:
			<br>
			The Hollywood Sign was built in 1923 as HOLLYWOODLAND as a promotion to sell real estate. It was flimsily made with wooden panels anchored by telephone poles, so it regularly blew over.The letters were 45ft tall and the characters were outlined by 4,000 light bulbs to make it flash in segments — HOLLY, then WOOD, then LAND, before lighting up entirely.</li>

With about 24 induction ceremonies annually broadcast around the world, the constant reinforcement provided to the public has made the Walk of Fame a top visitor attraction. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is undoubtedly one of the most successful marketing ideas ever produced in the whole world.
